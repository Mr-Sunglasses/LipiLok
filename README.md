# ü§î Pre-requisites

- `python3`
- `pdm`

## üêç Python Version Support

This project is designed to be compatible with specific versions of Python for optimal performance and stability.

### Supported Python Version

- **Python>=3.10**

> ‚ùóÔ∏è For the best experience and performance, it is recommended to use the version mentioned above.

Before diving into the project, ensure that you have the correct Python version installed. To check the version of Python you currently have, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python --version
```

### üêç Installing Python 3.10 with `pyenv`

**Protip:** Managing multiple Python versions is a breeze with [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv). It allows you to seamlessly switch between different Python versions without the need to reinstall them.

If you haven't installed `pyenv` yet, follow their [official guide](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to set it up.

Once you have `pyenv` ready, install the recommended Python version by running:

```bash
pyenv install 3.10
```

> When you navigate to this project's directory in the future, `pyenv` will automatically select the recommended Python version, thanks to the `.python-version` file in the project root.

# üì¶ Setup

## Note: We use `.env` to define the download model, So create `.env` with respective model name from the table of models or Defaulf model will be selected as `MODEL="en"`

```env
MODEL="MODEL NAME"
```

### We currently support these models

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Model</th>
    <th>Size</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>en</td>
    <td>84M</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>en_large</td>
    <td>284M</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>hi</td>
    <td>75M</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>hi_large</td>
    <td>374M</td>
  </tr>
</table>
